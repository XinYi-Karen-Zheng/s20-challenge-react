# Spring '20 React Challenge

Hey there! Welcome to the DP's web dev challenge~

The goal of this challenge is for you to demonstrate the ability to:

1. Build polished, production grade websites
2. Build products with minimal direction
3. Work within a set timeline

Using React is by no means a requirement for this challenge, you can find
starter code for completing this challenge in pure html, jquery, and css
[here](https://github.com/dailypenn/s20-challenge). If you're more comfortable
completing this challenge using some other frontend library or framework like
Angular, Vue, Preact, Elm, Svelte (or one of the thousand other competing frameworks out there) or anything else really, go ahead! We want to judge
you at your best, so use whatever tooling you're most comfortable with!

In this challenge, you'll be building something you may have seen before:
a quiz for [Under the Button](https://www.underthebutton.com/article/2020/01/parents-obligated-talk). We'll be
providing you with the quiz's content in a file called data.js, but
building out the website is completely up to you!

## Getting Started
- Clone a local copy of this repository by running `git clone https://github.com/dailypenn/s20-challenge-react`
- Navigate to the cloned repo in the terminal and run `yarn install` or `npm install`
- Run `yarn start` or `npm start`

Note: This project is boostrapped with Create React App (CRA), so hot-reloading has been configured. This means after you run yarn start or npm start, the application will be recompiled automatically after a file is edited. 

## Requirements
- We want you to duplicate the functionality of this [quiz](https://www.underthebutton.com/article/2020/01/parents-obligated-talk). This means showing each of the questions with their options as a form that people can fill out and submit for a response.
- Your code should injest data.json for content to show in the form. If we edit data.json, your website should update appropriately.
- The questions in data.json have four options (A, B, C, D). Do not assume this invariant - questions can have more than four options, and their property names do not have to be letters.
- Your quiz should be functional. The response shown doesn't have to match UTB's actual form, but it should atleast be reproducible. Selecting answers and submitting should show one of the responses. Reloading the page and selecting the same answers should show the same response.
