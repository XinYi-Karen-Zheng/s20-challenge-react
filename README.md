# Spring '20 React Challenge

Hey there! Welcome to the DP's web dev challenge~

The goal of this challenge is for you to demonstrate the ability to:

1. Build polished, production grade websites
2. Build products with minimal direction
3. Work within a set timeline

Using React is by no means a requirement for this challenge, you can find
starter code for completing this challenge in pure html, jquery, and css
[here](https://github.com/dailypenn/s20-challenge). If you're more comfortable
completing this challenge using some other frontend library or framework like
Angular, Vue, Preact, Elm, Svelte (or one of the thousand other competing frameworks out there) or anything else really, go ahead! We want to judge
you at your best, so use whatever tooling you're most comfortable with!

In this challenge, you'll be building something you may have seen before:
a quiz for [Under the Button](https://www.underthebutton.com/). We'll be
providing you with the quiz's content in a file called data.js, but
building out the website is completely up to you!

## Getting Started
- Clone a local copy of this repository by running `git clone https://github.com/dailypenn/s20-challenge-react`
- Navigate to the cloned repo in the terminal and run `yarn install` or `npm install`
- Run `yarn start` or `npm start`

Note: This project is boostrapped with Create React App (CRA), so hot-reloading has been configured. This means after you run yarn start or npm start, the application will be recompiled automatically after a file is edited. 

## Requirements
- We want you to duplicate the general functionality of this [quiz](https://www.underthebutton.com/article/2020/01/parents-obligated-talk)
- We have provided data.js, which contains an object with properties questions and responses. In our example we provided only questions with four options, A, B, C and D, but we want you to support adding more options with different names (i.e. A, B, Z, H or First, Second, Third).
- There are no requirements on how you map from quiz responses to results other than that it be reproducible and seem random.
